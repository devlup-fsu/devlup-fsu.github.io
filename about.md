# About:

## We're a Game Dev Club!

We're a small, but passionate group of students at Florida State University with a passion for making games. Whether it's the design, art, code, storytelling or music, we love it, and we're working on it!

Members frequently share what they're working on on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VY5WnDRne7) - either personal projects, part of their degree, or their portfolio of work they're using to break into the games industry (wish them luck)!

We hold meetings every Thursday in the Innovation Hub! Once again, join our Discord (see icons above) to be notified when meetings take place!

## What's "DevLUp"?

Previously known as the UF Game Developer's Association (UF GDA), DevLUp is a non-profit student organization that works to bring game development to schools across Florida.

We're what's called a "branch" of DevLUp, and they've given us permission to use their name, tools, and network of industry professionals and talented students to help our organization succeed! 

[They have a super cool site with a live feed of work members have posted across every branch's Discord that you can visit here!](https://devlup.org)
