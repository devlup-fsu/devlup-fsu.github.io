## Hello and Welcome!

This is DevLUP @ FSU's second-ish year in operation, and we're finally coming into full form. We've started cooperating with the IHub and the Seminole Innovators, we've put together some successful games and game jams, and our board is projected to have 256 members by 2030.

We've not really specialized since last year - we teach, we learn, we make, we play. Maybe that dilutes our purpose, but so far, we've been successful being everything to do with making video games.

There's still plenty to do, and we'll always be changing and growing, but for now, we're glad to be taking you along with us.

This year, we're primarily doing workshops, with presenters doing something live to follow along, question, suggest, or just watch. We stick to free software that any old laptop can run, which is why we’re not really teaching any industry standard tools - we’re aiming to teach the concepts and the process, not necessarily the tool itself.

While we mainly communicate through Discord, we’re going to make a page here on our site for each meeting. The posts will have all of the links to materials and software, copies of our meeting slides, and links to recordings of meetings. If you have any further questions, the answer’s always the same: ask on our Discord linked above!

# Why do we do it?

Generally, we’re focused on workshops that educate our members on all aspects game development, participating in and hosting game jams to give our members opportunities to make games and apply what they’ve learned, and helping our members navigate the world of games industry recruiting to get internships and the like by reaching our to recruiters/people in the games business to talk to us and reviewing members' portfolios and resumes.

Another thing you may have heard is that we’re part of a larger non-profit organization called DevLUp. DevLUp was started by UF students to create a network of game development-focused student organizations across Florida universities. We share our resources as well as access to recruiters and industry personnel, especially for recruiters that find it difficult to make time to talk to schools like ours with no game development focus - grouping us together helps justify talking to us.

There’s more on this stuff on the [/about](/about) page.

Really though, as people, the reasoning isn't very complicated:

We love games, and we love dev.

Some of us are here for coding the solutions to unique, interesting problems ([game dev easily takes the cake for the funniest patch notes of all software](https://kotaku.com/pregnant-sims-can-no-longer-brawl-and-other-amazing-sim-1506014739)), some of us are here because we love the worlds and characters games allow us to create, to extend our imaginations in a way no other media can. Some of us are just bored and have nothing else to do.
We’re aiming to engage with you no matter where you fall on the spectrum.

Thanks,  
Dion and Jake and Whalen and Chris and Emma and Jordan and Parker and Ares and Mike and Chris Mills and Thumbs Up Man
