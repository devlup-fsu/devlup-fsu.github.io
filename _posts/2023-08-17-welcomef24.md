## Hello and Welcome!

Welcome to many things:
- A new semester!
- A new website!
- A new DevLUp FSU Board!
- A new way of our organization operating…

We’re still a relatively new club - at the time of writing, less than a year old! But, we’ve come a long way in terms of finding our niche on campus and figuring out what we do, what we’re about, and who we are - our identity.

I think it’s easy for organizations like ours to run into a bit of an identity crisis - what does a club organized around game development even do? It may seem obvious, make games, right? But, consider the breadth of possibility here. It’s not as easy as it seems.

Do we teach games, do play games, do we make a game/games?

Do we assume you’re already excited about making games, do we assume you know what kinds of things you want to make?

Do we assume you know nothing, do we assume you know everything?

Why are we even here?

We’re gonna try to answer those questions here, and in our meetings to come; we're working on our elevator pitch as we go...

There was definitely some discussion, some searching, and some experimentation needed to land where we are now. But after all, I think we can be really proud of what we have planned for this semester. Now it’s just up to the follow-through - wish us luck.

Generally, the format we'd like to follow is that "talks"  are presentations shorter than an hour, while workshops may take longer and involve someone doing something live with the option to follow along, ask questions and make suggestions. For workshops, we stick to free software that any old laptop can run, which is why we're not really teaching any industry standard tools - we're aiming to teach the concepts and the process, not necessarily the tool itself. For our more complex topics, we have a talk followed by a workshop, for a kind of theory and practice division.

While we mainly communicate through discord, we're going to make a page here, on our site, for each meeting that has all of the links to materials and software, copies of our meeting slides and links to recordings of meetings. If you have any further questions, the answer's always the same: ask on our discord linked above!

# Why do we do it?

Generally, we’re focused on these workshops and talks that educate our members on all aspects game development, participating in and hosting game jams to give our members opportunities to make games and apply what they’ve learned, and helping our members navigate the world of games industry recruiting to get internships and the like by reaching our to recruiters/people in the games business to talk to us and reviewing members' portfolios and resumes.

Another thing you may have heard is that we’re part of a larger non-profit organization called DevLUp. DevLUp was started by UF students to create a network of game development focused student organizations across Florida universities. We generally try to share resources and access to recruiters and industry personnel - especially for recruiters that find it difficult to make time to talk to schools like ours with no game development focus, grouping us together helps justify talking to us.

There’s more on this stuff on the [/about](/about) page.

Really though, as people, the reasoning isn't very complicated:

We love games, and we love dev.

Some of us are here for coding the solutions to unique, interesting problems ([game dev easily takes the cake for the funniest patch notes of all software](https://kotaku.com/pregnant-sims-can-no-longer-brawl-and-other-amazing-sim-1506014739)), some of us are here because we love the worlds and characters games allow us to create, to extend our imaginations in a way no other media can. Some of us are just bored and have nothing else to do.
We’re aiming to engage with you no matter where you fall on the spectrum.

Thanks,  
Dion and Jake and Walen and Chris and Emma and Jordan and Parker and Ares and Mike and Chris Mills and Thumbs Up Man
