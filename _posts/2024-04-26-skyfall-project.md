# About The Sky Is Falling

“The Sky is Falling” is a 3D Arcade style platforming game inspired by the characters and world of the movie “Chicken Little”. The player dodges items thrown at them from a UFO to survive as long as possible until they are knocked out and abducted! This game was made over three workshops to teach 3D development, art, and animation.
