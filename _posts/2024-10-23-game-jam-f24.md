The game jam will last 48 hours and **start November 1st (Friday) at 5:00 PM and end November 3rd (Sunday) 6:00 PM**. The theme will be announced at 6:00 PM November 1st giving us an hour to form teams and socialize.

We will meet **in the FSU Innovation Hub** (in the Shores Building) each day. You can come in person any hours it'll be open (times TBD) or participate asynchronously through online communication with your team.

Bring your friends or come alone and make some new ones. We will be forming groups at our Thursday workshop and on Friday from 5:00 - 6:00 PM.
